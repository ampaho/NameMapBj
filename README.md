# NameMapBj
R scripts to draw last name distribution in Benin on the map.

The next step is to build an R package to make geospatial analysis about Benin in fewer lines of code, for tasks such as:

By arrondissement:
* How many people between 10 and 15 are there in Benin?
* What's the doctor/population ration across the nation?
* What's the oldest arrondissement in Benin?
