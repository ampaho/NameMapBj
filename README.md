# NameMapBj
R scripts to draw last name distribution in Benin on the map.

The next step is to build an R package to make geospatial analysis about Benin in fewer lines of code, for tasks such as:

By arrondissement and demographics:
* How many people between 10 and 15 are there in Benin?
* What's the doctor/population count ration across the nation?
* What's the oldest arrondissement in Benin?


Society:
* What's the median age for each profession
* The state with the most diverse professionally

Health:
* How many hospitals by arrondissements
* Ratio number of hospitals/population
* Illness cases

Labor
* How many days of strike by department/ministry (Public)
* How many days of strike by department/ministry (Private)
* How many employees for the state
